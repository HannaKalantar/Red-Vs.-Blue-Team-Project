# Red-Vs.-Blue-Team-Project

In this project, I worked on a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which I played the role of a both pentester and SOC analyst.

In the Red Team, I attacked a vulnerable VM within my environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. During my time in the Blue Team, I used Kibana to review logs taken during Red Team activities. I used the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for my report.

In this project I also interpreted my log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that I've successfully performed.




**Project Objectives That Were Achieved**

1) Penetration testing with Kali Linux.

2) Log and incident analysis with Kibana.

3) System hardening and configuration.

4) Reporting, documentation, and communication.
